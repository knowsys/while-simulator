## Dependencies

All dependencies must be bundles in the build. External resources such as CDN must not be used.

## Code style

-   JavaScript named exports must be used instead of default exports
-   Function components should be used instead of class components
-   Code must be auto-formatted using Prettier (e. g. `npm run lint`)
